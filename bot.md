# Game of Greed Bot

**Author**: Chris Stanley<br>
**Version**: 1.0.0<br>

## Overview
The goal was to see if the programmer could create an automated program that playes the game instead of a person. It should only use the input, print and calculate score functions from the game.

## Getting Started
To recreate a simular bot I would reccomend eiter building and/or playing the game extensivly.

## Architecture
The bot class consists of a replacement function for the `_print` and `_input` methods in the game class. These allow the bot to see what the user would had instead seen.

## APIs
The bot program uses the counter from python collections and Regular Expresstion for string manipulation

v 1.0 8:00pm 12/12/2019 Finished porting the bot from my code to work on the version of the game in `game_jb.py`.
